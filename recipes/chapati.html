    <h2>How to Make Whole Wheat Chapati</h2>
    <p>Whole wheat chapati, also known as roti, is a staple in many Indian households. It is a simple and healthy flatbread made from whole wheat flour, water, and a pinch of salt. Chapati is often served with Indian curries, vegetables, or lentils, but can also be eaten on its own or used as a wrap. To make whole wheat chapati, start by mixing the flour, salt, and water together to form a soft dough. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Then, divide the dough into small balls, roll them out into thin circles, and cook them on a hot griddle until they are lightly browned and puffed up. Whole wheat chapati is a nutritious and delicious bread that is easy to make and can be enjoyed with a variety of dishes.</p>
